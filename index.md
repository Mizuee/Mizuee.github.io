### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 2 was a favorite because my partner and I were able to create an image that looked like tv static along with words display. In this program, I was able to incorporate functions and previous knowledge regarding files with a lot of confidence. Also, being able to see my work at the end with a custom message was rewarding.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 3 was a favorite of mine because it signified the start of my career as a computer scientist. Printing "Hello World" is a tradition in this field and I am happy to be a part of it. Also, I was able to use cout in order to print things for one of the first times.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite of mine because in this program I made one of the earlier versions of a guessing game we did in this course with my partner. This part really tested me and helped me grow in this field with all of the different tools we used. The different types of loops in the program along with the way we manipulated them made this a fun and challenging code.
